# Store-Sales-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Store Sales Data Analysis is a project for analysing the sales of a store using interactive dashboard using the feature of Advanced Excel.

I made a project using Ms-Excel features to analyze annual sells of a shop in every months of a year through different source like online e-commerce platform and this analysis will help in predicting sells of next year. In this project, I covered data cleaning, analyzing and formatting concepts also I plot the graphs and interactive dashboard to visualize the data to understand easily.
